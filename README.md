# Hello.

## Who am I?
My name is **Peter Stanke**, living + born in Germany. I am currently working for [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/) as Data Center Upgrade Technician in the german datacenter. Before that I was working as electrician but I moved to the IT world since I was always in this stuff.

## What are doing here on GitHub?
Well... to be honest I am not a full stack programmer or whatever it's called. I do know some basic stuff about everything and that's enough for me.
Usually I check some repos and try to help with some basic stuff like commenting on issues or fixing small stuff via PRs.

## For which repos do you 'work'?
